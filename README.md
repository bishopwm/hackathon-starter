# hackathon-starter
If you have attended hackathons in the past, you know how much time it takes to get a project started. From that first second when you get thinking on what to build, to picking a programming language, and then deciding what framework to useâ€”it doesn't end there, and the list goes on! That's precisely why this page is here! We've compiled a list of resources to help you get started with minimal time and effort. 

Happy Hacking!

# Miro App examples
Our [Miro App Examples repository](https://github.com/miroapp/app-examples) provides various examples of apps built on top of Miro's Developer Platform 2.0.

## Web SDK

The fastest way to bootstrap a new app is by using [`create-miro-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-miro-app). Read more about building your first Hello World app [here](https://beta.developers.miro.com/docs/build-your-first-hello-world-app).

The following table lists app examples that use the Miro Web SDK.
